    <h1>The Best Movies Of All Time 🔥</h1>

    <h2>My Top 3 👑</h2>
    <hr />
    
    <h3>
        1. Batman: Dark Knight Rises🦇
    </h3>
    <p>
        The greatest movie of all time because of the inspiration felt through this movie
        for sure a great watch. #Christian Bale is a legend
    </p>
    <h3>
        2. Home Alone 1 and 2🏠🌲🎅🏻
    </h3>
    <p>
        I know you said that it should be one movie but these two are a
        bundle deal when it comes to true entertainment.
    </p>
    <h3>
        3. Rocky 🥊🏃🏻
    </h3>
    <p>
       This is on everyones top list because it is one of the best. A underdog that becomes great will always be a heart warming story.
